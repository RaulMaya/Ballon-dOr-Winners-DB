### About

<p>The application is organized into two main parts: the server-side code and the client-side code. The server-side code is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses, processing user input, and managing the notes stored in the JSON file. The client-side code is responsible for displaying the user interface and sending requests to the server-side code via HTTP.</p>

<p>The server-side code uses Express.js to create an HTTP server and handle routes for creating, reading and deleting notes. The notes are stored in a JSON file using the fs module provided by Node.js.</p>

<p>The client-side code is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses fetch() to make requests to the server-side code. The user interface is simple and intuitive, with a sidebar that displays all the notes and a main area that displays the content of the selected note.</p>

<p>Overall, the Notes-App project is a great example of a simple yet effective note-taking application built using Node.js and the Express.js framework. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications or as a learning resource for those new to web development with Node.js.
</p>
